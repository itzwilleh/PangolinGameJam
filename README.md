# Pangolin Game Jam Project


Project for Mohawk College Game Jam #1, April 2018. Finished game had to somehow incorporate either the given sprite or 3D model of a pangolin. 

Code is pretty rough and void of comments; lots of attributes were public so they could be manually set in the inspector. Once a polished version of the game is ready, a link will be provided here to a separate git repo.


__Work by__:

[Porsche Le](https://github.com/PorscheLe7) - audio design, main menu

[Evan Mulrooney](https://dog-eared.github.io) - tongue mechanics, level management, ant movement 

[Jess Nguyen](https://github.com/Jess-Nguy) - timer, audio management

William Nguyen - level design, tilemaps, main menu 

__Things that were cut__:

Powerups, day/night cycle - we just couldn't get them working in time for presentations. We had the code, but not enough time.

Spitball Powerup

Ants Screaming in Fear

Pangolin Movement
