# Pangolin Game Jam Project

Project for Mohawk College Game Jam #1, April 2018. Finished game had to somehow incorporate either the given sprite or 3D model of a pangolin. 

__Work by__:
Porsche Le - audio design, main menu
[Evan Mulrooney](dog-eared.github.io/portfolio) - tongue mechanics, level management, ant movement 
Jess Nguyen - timer, audio management
William Nguyen - level design, tilemaps, main menu 

__Things that were cut__:
Powerups, day/night cycle - we just couldn't get them working in time for presentations. We had the code, but not enough time.
Spitball Powerup
Ants Screaming in Fear
Pangolin Movement
